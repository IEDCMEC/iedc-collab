    Build: A new feature or Feat: A new feature.
    Fix: A bug fix.
    Docs: Documentation only changes.
    Style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).

    Perf: A code change that improves performance.
    Test: Adding missing tests.
    Chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation.

    etc.
